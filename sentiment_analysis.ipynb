    "# TWITTER SENTIMENT ANALYSIS  USING NLP\n",
    "Twitter is one of the most popular microblogging sites. Twitter users create “tweets” (status messages) about different topics based on their opinion. The purpose of this project is to automatically analyse the sentiment (positive or negative) of tweet. This is very useful because it allows feedback to aggregate without manual intervention.  \n",
    "• Organizations can also use this to gather critical feedback about problems in newly released products.\n",
    "\n",
    "• Marketers can use this to research public opinion of their company and products, or to analyse customer satisfaction. \n",
    "\n",
    "• Consumers can use sentiment analysis to research products or services before making a purchase. "
